# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

This repository contains the course projects for the Courseraâ€™s Exploratory Data Analysis class. 

## The Project1

Overall goal of the project was to create 4 plots (described below) examining household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Original data was obtained from UCI website https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption. All four plots were constructed using base plotting system. Complete work was done on my local directory and pushed to GitHub after completion of the entire project.
